            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p> In this project, me and my partner had used what we learned about CSS and HTML in order to create our own movie poster. The title for the movie that me and my partner decided on was <strong>The Smiling Emoji.</strong></p>
            <p> This movie serves as a sequel to the original Emoji Movie. In this fake comedy movie, the smiling emoji has come back to get revenge on the malfunctioning emoji Meh and her daughter/The princess, all while showing the Textopolis her true smile. </p>
            <p> Over the course of our work, one of the most difficult part of finishing it all was figuring out how to implement the fonts into our webpage. At first, me and my partner were just implementing every code from the font that we needed into the CSS page. However, when we tried to apply the font to the paragraph(p) element, it kept showing a completely different font. When we tried to figure this issue out ourselves, it ended up taking a long while. That was when we decided to ask our teacher/Mr.Mueller, for help. Turns out that we needed to the code with the "link rel" inside of the "<head>" of our html.</p>
            <p> My biggest takeaways throughout this project was understanding how to add inputs and fonts correctly into HTML. While also working with another person and communicating effectively with them. Before this project, there were a lot of things I did not understand about HTML, but now I was able to expand my knowledge of using HTML inputs and other elements. Which not only helped me understand HTML and CSS, but my partner was able to learn from me, as I was able to learn from him. The next steps that I want to take going forward is to get as much pratice using different HTML elements as I can, so that I can be better prepared for when I have to start creating the basic codes for any future projects that require me to make a website.</p>
